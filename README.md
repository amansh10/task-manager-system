# üìù Task Manager System (C++ CLI Project)

A fully functional Task Manager built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. This command-line interface (CLI) application allows users to manage tasks efficiently, with support for adding, viewing, editing, filtering, prioritizing, and marking tasks as completed.

## üöÄ Features

- üì• **Add Task** ‚Äî Input task name, category, description, due date, and priority.
- üìÉ **View Tasks**
  - View **all tasks**
  - View tasks **based on priority** (highest first using `priority_queue`)
- üóÉÔ∏è **Filter by Category** ‚Äî View tasks grouped by category.
- ‚úÖ **Mark Task as Completed** ‚Äî Flag tasks as done.
- üìù **Edit Task** ‚Äî Modify any attribute: name, category, description, due date.
- ‚ùå **Delete Task** ‚Äî Remove a task by name.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **C++** with STL
  - `vector` for storing task objects
  - `unordered_map` for category filtering (extendable)
  - `priority_queue` for task prioritization
- CLI-based Input/Output

## üîç OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | Where It's Used                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Class & Object**  | `Task`, `Menu`                                  |
| **Encapsulation**   | Private data management within classes         |
| **Constructor**     | Task object creation                           |
| **Inheritance (optional)** | Menu controlling Task class               |
| **Polymorphism**    | (Can be extended with virtual base if needed) |

   ./taskmanager
   ```

## üß† Learnings & Highlights

> "Initially, I thought this project would be easier since I had experience with OOP and STL. But implementing each feature forced me to revisit concepts like constructor chaining, I/O management, use of STL containers in real scenarios, and debugging logic for consistent state updates."

- Discovered the importance of `getline()` vs `cin` for multi-word input.
- Learned how to prioritize using `priority_queue` with pairs.
- Understood the value of proper input buffering and task encapsulation.
- Used `cin.ignore()` smartly to clean up newline artifacts during inputs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- Add file-based persistence (save/load tasks).
- Enhance due date handling with proper `date` parsing.
- Use flags instead of string hacks for marking completed tasks.
- Integrate unit tests (Google Test or Catch2).
